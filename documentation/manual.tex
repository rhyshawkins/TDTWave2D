\section{Introduction}

This software contains a general framework for the inversion of 2D imaging
problems using a Bayesian Trans-dimensional Tree approach. For an
introduction to the Trans-dimensional Tree method, see \citet{Hawkins:2015:A}.
For example geophysical applications of this method \citep{Dettmer:2016:A,Hawkins:2017:A}.

\section{Installation}

The main framework is in the source code in the {\tt base} directory, with a
demonstration of a regression problem in the {\tt generalregressioncpp} directory,
a linearized tomography surface wave problem in the {\tt generaltomocpp} directory,
and a Fortran regression problem example in {\tt generalregressionf} directory..

This code is expected to be run on a Unix machine and requires the
following packages to compile:

\begin{itemize}
\item GNU g++ Version 6.x or greater
\item GNU fortran Version 6.x or greater
\item GNU Make version 4.x or greater
\item GNU Scientific Library (GSL) version 1 or 2
\item OpenMPI version 1.10
\end{itemize}

It is also assumed that the TDTbase libraries are installed and
compiled in the same top level directory as this codebase, for
example, the directory structure is as follows

\begin{itemize}
\item ParentDirectory
  \begin{itemize}
  \item TDTbase
  \item TDTWave2D
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The source code with example scripts and data is called
TDTWave2D.tar.gz and once the environment is properly
configued, extraction and compilation can proceed as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
> tar -xzf TDTWave2D.tar.gz
> cd TDTWave2D
> make -C base
> make -C generalregressioncpp
> make -C generaltomocpp 
> make -C generalregressionf
\end{verbatim}

\section{Tutorial on Running the Regression Example}

In the {\tt generalregressioncpp/example} directory, there is an example
synthetic regression problem showing various options for inversion.
The Makefile in this directory contains the commmands that are described
in the following paragraphs.

\subsection{Creating a synthetic dataset}

The synthetic observation generating program requires a synthetic
image and a set of sythetic points for a regression problem. Python scripts
are available to provide both, first for the random points:

\begin{verbatim}
python2 ../../scripts/generatetempatepoints.py -N 100 -o datatemplate.txt
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt -N} option specifies the number of points. By default the domain
of the points will be -1 $\ldots$ 1 for both $x$ and $y$ directions.

Secondly, the image can be generated using

\begin{verbatim}
python2 ../../scripts/generatetemplateimage.py -W 32 -H 32 \
  -m Gaussian \
  -o imagetemplategaussian.txt
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt -W} and {\tt -H} specify the width and height of the image in pixels
and both must be powers of 2. The {\tt -m} option specifies the synthetic
model, options are Constant for an homogeneous image and Gaussian for a Gaussian
hill.

Finally, using these two files as input, synthetic observations can be constructed
with noise using:

\begin{verbatim}
../mksyntheticregression \
  -i imagetemplategaussian.txt \
  -I datatemplate.txt \
  -N 0.05 \
  -o syntheticobs_gaussian.txt
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt -N} option specifies the level of noise. By default the range of image
amplitude is between 0 and 1, so 0.05 is a 5\% error level.

\subsection{Prior/Proposal Specification}

The Trans-dimensional tree approach with a wavelet parameterisation adds and removes
wavelet coefficients to a wavelet model that can represent an image. The wavelet coefficients,
by construction, are organised in a hierarchy from coarse to fine length scale. This
means the prior specification is non-intuitive. The recommended and simplest
approach to specification of the prior is to use either a fixed or hierarchical
Laplacian prior as this gives generally good performance and is far simpler to
specify.

The prior and proposals are specified in a single text file which we give
an example below (taken from {\tt generalregressioncpp/example/priorproposal.txt})

\begin{verbatim}
laplace
0.1
priorbirth
depthgaussianperturb
5
0.025
0.035
0.050
0.050
0.050
\end{verbatim}

The first two lines specify a Laplacian prior with 0.1 width (similar to standard
deviation). This 0.1 value may need to be adjusted if a fixed Laplacian prior is
used in the inversion and birth/death acceptance is poor.

The next line specifies how birth/death proposals are performed, it is
suggested that this is always left as {\tt priorbirth} meaning new
wavelet coefficients are sampled from the prior.

The rest of the file specifies the proposal used for change of value
proposals for wavelet coefficients. The example here, {\tt
  depthgaussianperturb}, means that each scale length of wavelet
coefficients is perturbed with a Gaussian proposal with independently
specified standard deviation. In this example we have specified 5
levels, however if the wavelet model has more than 5 levels, it uses
the last level specified for higher levels so this specification
doesn't need to match the size of the wavelet model.

For tuning the acceptance rates of an inversion, this set of standard
deviations may need to adjusted to attempt to achieve an acceptance
rate between 20 and 50 percent. 

\subsection{Serial Inversion}

The way these codes work is that they run for a specified number of
iterations and output statistical information to a series of files.
To run a short inversion of the synthetic data, the following
could be used:

\begin{verbatim}
mkdir -p results_gaussian
../regressiontdtwave2d -i syntheticobs_gaussian.txt \
  -M priorproposal.txt \
  -o results_gaussian/ \
  -v 10000 \
  -x 5 -y 5 -t 1000000 -w 4
\end{verbatim}

The parameters are described as follows:

\begin{description}
\item [-i] The observations input file
\item [-M] The prior/proposal file described in the previous section
\item [-o] The results file(s) output prefix (append a ``/'') to output to a
  directory.
\item [-v] Verbosity or how often the running diagnostics are output
\item [-x/y] The width and height of the model image expressed as a power of two. In
  the above example, the image is $2^5$ or 32 by 32 pixels.
\item [-t] The total number of iterations
\item [-w] The wavelet basis to use. Ranges from 0 (coarse) to 4 (smooth) bases.
\end{description}

In the {\tt results\_gaussian} directory, there will be a number of files written,
described as follows:

\begin{description}
\item[acceptance.txt] the final acceptance rates of the simulation for the different
  proposal types.
\item[ch.dat] the chain history (binary)
\item[final\_model.txt] the final model (useful for continuing Markov chains)
\item[khistogram.txt] the histogram of the number of wavelet coefficients
\item[residuals.txt] the mean residuals for each observation.
\end{description}

The most important of these for analysis/visualization of the results is the chain
history file {\tt ch.dat} that contains all the models of the ensemble.
Information can be extracted from the chain history file with post processing
commands, for example, to obtain a mean image:

\begin{verbatim}
../postprocess_mean -i results_gaussian/ch.dat \
  -s 5000 \
  -t 10 \
  -x 5 -y 5 -w 4 \
  -o results_gaussian/mean.txt
\end{verbatim}

The various parameters here are descibed as follows

\begin{description}
\item[-i] The input chain history file
\item[-s] The number of models to skip from the processing (i.e. burnin samples that
  are thrown away).
\item[-t] Thinning, or in the example above, only every tenth model is used.
\item[-x/y] The size of the image (this must match the inversion).
\item[-w] The wavelet basis to use (this must match the inversion).
\item[-o] The output mean image to write.
\end{description}

The mean image is writen in text format and can be visualized simply
with python, for example

\begin{verbatim}
import numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as P

img = numpy.loadtxt('results_gaussian/mean.txt')
fig, ax = P.subplots()
ax.imshow(img)
P.show()
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Further examples}

Several other use cases of the commands described above are shown in the
{\tt generalregressioncpp/example/Makefile} file, including examples
of running parallel the version.
  
\subsection{Diagnostics}

The program will output log messages periodically depending on the
verbosity level (default is every 1000 iterations). This information
includes the time which is useful for estimation of remaining running
time by looking at the time difference between two log outputs.  The
first line contains the iterations number (10000), the current
negative log likelihood with the misfit (46.4) and normalization shown
in brackets (-300). The next number (51) is the number of wavelet
coefficients, followed by the dc or mean of the model image. Lambda is
the hierarchical scaling parameter, and T is the temperature.  An
abridged example of the output is shown below

{
  \tiny
\begin{verbatim}
2018-05-14 01:29:11:...:000  10000: 46.446122(-300.492166) 51 dc 0.723397 lambda 1.000000 T 1.000000:
2018-05-14 01:29:11:...:Birth:    516  49.806:  0.000  33.333  27.273  22.581  52.121  76.687 
2018-05-14 01:29:11:...:Death:    500  41.400:  0.000   0.000  15.909  16.854  41.463  68.023 
2018-05-14 01:29:11:...:Value:   8984  47.362: 29.804  17.532  22.280  44.542  71.097  76.858 
\end{verbatim}
}

A key component of monitoring these inversions is the acceptance
rates, particularly for the value proposals. In the example output
above, the last line shows the statistics for the value proposals. The
first number is the number of value proposals so far, the next number
before the colon is the average acceptance rate across the hierarchcy
of wavelet coefficients. The remaining numbers are the individual
acceptance rates at each level, in this case levels 0 $\ldots$
5. Ideally, the acceptace rates for these coefficients should be
between approximately 20 and 50 percent and this is especially
important for levels 0, 1, 2, and maybe 3. It is often the case that
the value proposal acceptance rates for higher levels is high, but of
little importance.

To tune these acceptance rates, editing of the {\tt priorproposal.txt}
file may be required. To lower the acceptance rate, in the case where it is too
high, the standard deviation of the particular level must be increased. The
reverse is true when the acceptance rate is too low, i.e. the standard deviation
of the perturbation should be decreased.

\section{Writing Custom Applications}

Each of the example applications are written as custom applications and as such
can be used as templates for incorporating your own physical modelling or
likelihood functions into an trans-dimensional tree inversion.

\subsection{Background}

For a custom application, the Likelihood function needs to be defined,
which can include any forward modelling.  The way the generic part of
the code is formulated is that it is assumed that each observation
needs to know the model image for the current iteration. A forward
model can take the values of the model at each point and compute a
prediction. For example, in a tomographic forward model, the ray path
integral can be approximated by a discrete summation to compute a
travel time prediction.

Lastly, the prediction is then compared to the observation and a
probabilisitic likelihood can be computed, commonly an indepedent
Gaussian likelihood, that is

\begin{equation}
  p(\mathbf{d}|\mathbf{m}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \prod_{i=1}^N \sigma_i} \exp \left\{
  - \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{(G(\mathbf{m})_i - d_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right\}
    ,
\end{equation}

where $G(\mathbf{m})_i$ is the prediction, $d_i$ is the observation,
$\sigma_i$ is the error on the observation. For accuracy, the negative
log likelihood is used and separated into

\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:like}
  \mathcal{L} = \sum_{i = 1}^N \frac{(G(\mathbf{m})_i - d_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \\
  \label{eqn:norm}
  \mathcal{N} = \log \left\{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \prod_{i=1}^N \sigma_i} \right\}
  ,
\end{align}

and these are called {\tt like} and {\tt norm} in the code
respectively. To implement a custom application, you first need to
derive the likelihood and the operation of the forward model based
on the model image. Then you need to implement some functions of
your own for running inversions. These functions are described in
the following sections for C++. The fortran interface is functionally
equivalent and the code implementing the regression problem in
{\tt generalregressionf/genericregression.f90} is commented and
should serve as a guide.

\subsection{Loading data}

The data file format is entirely in the control of the programmer.
The command line application is passed a filename to load, and this is
passed onto the load function directly. This file could be a raw data
file or a configuration file that points to a series of files that
require loading for the inverse problem. This function must load all
necessary data for subsequent calculation of predictions and the
likelihood. The interface is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  int tdtwave2d_loaddata_(int *n,
                          const char *filename,
                          int *width,
                          int *height);
\end{verbatim}

The parameters are

\begin{description}
\item[n] The length of the filename string
\item[filename] The filename to load
\item[width] The width of the model image
\item[height] The height of the model image
\end{description}

The first parameter is only needed for Fortran problems. This is also
the reason that the integer parameters are passed as pointers.

It is up to the custom application to permanently store any data
necessary for the likelihood or calculation of predictions in this
function.

The function should return zero on success and negative one for any
error.  This will subsequently terminate the main program.

\subsection{Computing predictions}

The next function that needs to be implemented is the function that
computes the predictions for a single observation. The C interface for
this function is shown below


\begin{verbatim}
  int tdtwave2d_compute_prediction_(int *observation,
                                    int *width, 
                                    int *height,
                                    const double *value,
                                    double *unused,
                                    double *prediction);
\end{verbatim}

The function passes in a observation index from 0 to the number of
observations minus one (i.e. using C indexing). A cautionary note here
for fortran users is that if the observations are stored in a standard
fortran array, one needs to be added to this index (see fortran
examples and the variable {\tt oi}).

At present there is a single output value that needs to be computed and
stored in the scalar prediction variable. This should be a value for regression
type problems or a travel time for tomography type problems. There is an unused
array currently in the code to allow for future improved functionality.

The function should return zero on success and negative one if there
is an error.

\subsection{Computing the likelihood}

The C++ interfaces for the function that needs to be implemented to
compute the likelihood are below:

\begin{verbatim}
  int tdtwave2d_compute_likelihood_(int *nobservation,
                                    double *hvalue,
                                    double *predictions,
                                    double *residuals,
                                    double *unused,
                                    double *like,
                                    double *norm);
\end{verbatim}

The input variables are

\begin{description}
\item[nobservation] The number of observations (size of the arrays passed in)
\item[hvalue] The hierarchical scale value
\item[predictions] The array of model predictions for each observation, i.e. the vector $G(\mathbf{m})$
\end{description}

When performing a hierarchical inversion where a noise term is
inverted for, the value hvalue is the hierarchical value that can be
used directly as the noise level on the data, or as a scaling term
used to scale the data errors. In non-hierarchical inversions, this value
will always be one and can be ignored.

The output variables that need to be set are

\begin{description}
\item[residuals] The array of residuals, i.e. the vector $G(\mathbf{m}) - \mathbf{d}$
\item[like] The negative log likelihood without the normalization constant, i.e. equation (\ref{eqn:like})
  for an independent Gaussian likelihood
\item[norm] The negative log of the likelihood normalization constant, i.e. equation (\ref{eqn:norm})
  for an independent Gaussian likelihood
\end{description}

There is additionally an unused parameter for future expansion that should be ignored
at this stage.

Again, this function should return zero on success and negative one on error.

\subsection{Synthetic Model Generation}

For synthetic model generation useful for testing, an additional function needs to be
implemented with the C++ and fortran interfaces below

\begin{verbatim}
  int tdtwave2d_savedata_(int *n,
                          const char *filename,
                          double *noiselevel,
                          int *nobservations,
                          double *predictions);
\end{verbatim}

The parameter {\tt n} and {\tt filename} specify the length and the name
of the file to create. The {\tt noiselevel} specifies the true Gaussian
noise added to the synthetic observations (this will be zero when
outputting the true observations). Lastly the {\tt nobservations} and
{\tt predictions} specify the array size and the array of synthetic
predictions that are to be output as the observations.

For synthetic model general (see the file {\tt mksynthetic.cpp}), a
template observation file will be loaded by calling {\tt tdtwave2d\_loaddata\_}
followed by {\tt tdtwave2d\_compute\_prediction\_} 

\subsection{Parallel implementation}

The generic interface is structured for observation parallelism so that if for example
a single chain is run on ten processors using the parallel version, observations are
evenly split between processors and residuals computed. The results are gathered on
a single processor where the likelihood is computed. In summary

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt tdtwave2d\_loaddata\_} is called by all processes at the beginning before
  the iterations begin
\item {\tt tdtwave2d\_compute\_prediction\_} is called for a subset of the observations
  on each processor
\item {\tt tdtwave2d\_compute\_likelihood\_} is called by one processor (as it is
  generally a trivial summation over the residuals).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recommendations}

The simplest path to starting a custom application is to copy 
the C++/Fortran regression example and use that as
a template.

For each of these examples, there is an example subdirectory
has a Makefile that

\begin{enumerate}
\item creates some synthetic template data using scripts included in this source
  bundle. This essentially creates empty observations but with random points (regression) or
  random paths (tomography) on the sphere.
\item creates synthetic data using the compute predictions implementation and adding
  some Gaussian noise
\item runs a short single process inversion
\item runs the post processing to compute the mean model and standard deviation.
\end{enumerate}

Both the source code for these programs and the simple examples provide good
starting points for creating custom applications.
